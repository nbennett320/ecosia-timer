## ecosia-plugin-react
**An easy to use tool that makes planting trees even easier**

### About
This is an implementation of my [Ecosia extension tool](https://github.com/nbennett320/ecosia-widget-react). On first inspection - perhaps based on the title - you might think this adds a timer to Ecosia, similar to Google(ðŸ¤¢)'s [timer feature](https://www.google.com/search?q=timer)........ And you'd be correct!
The idea is that cool new features will help reel in new users to Ecosia, and new Ecosia users === more trees planted ðŸŒ³ðŸ’ž.
